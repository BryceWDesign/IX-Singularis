# Field Feedback Telemetry Interface ‚Äì IX-Singularis  
*Subsystem Documentation: Real-Time Harmonic Field Sensor Data and Closed-Loop System Logic*

---

## üß† Purpose

This interface synchronizes **all live sensor data**, harmonic beam health, envelope modulation, and cryogenic thermal drift into a unified controller matrix.

The goal is **autonomous phase-lock correction** and **harmonic field stabilization** with zero manual tuning during operation.

## üîÅ Output Control Channels

| Target | Signal Type | Action |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Beam Phase Modulator | DAC Analog | Adjusts individual node waveform timing |
| Bifilar Coil Driver  | PWM        | Controls envelope tension torque |
| CryoCore Coolant Loop | PID Loop  | Adjusts coolant flow and ramp timing |
| Emergency Phase Dump | Digital Pulse | Forces harmonic null-reset pattern |

## üîÑ Loop Timing & Response

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Feedback Loop Time | < 300 ns |
| Maximum Event Handling Rate | 5,000 corrections/sec |
| Oversampling Buffer | 8x per input |  

System is **noise-tolerant** to ¬±0.8 dB analog jitter  
Field stabilization integrity is maintained down to **1.2¬∞ RMS phase deviation** before triggering damping intervention.

## üíæ Controller Hardware

- Main Board: **TunerCore DSP v3**  
- Processor: ARM Cortex M7 (or STM32H7)  
- Memory: 1MB RAM, 4MB Flash minimum  
- Analog Front-End: 16-bit ADC, 4MSPS per channel

## üîê System Fail Modes

| Condition | Trigger | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Phase Spike >10¬∞ RMS | EM sensor surge | Trigger phase-dump + alert |
| Cryo Drift >4¬∞C/min  | Thermal IR + contact diff | Emergency coolant pulse |
| Neutron/Gamma Burst  | Detector interrupt | Lock harmonic nodes, envelope clamps inward |
| Envelope Overmodulation | Overdrive detected | Clamp coil amplitude, enter passive damping |

## üß™ Diagnostics & Calibration

- System can perform **self-calibration**:
  - Using known field pattern injection sequences
  - Measuring harmonic reflection vs expected node gain

- All data is loggable to SD or remote interface via USB/serial/ethernet
