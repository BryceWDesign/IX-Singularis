# CryoCore Feedback Loop – IX-Singularis  
*Control Subsystem: Closed-Loop Cryogenic Regulation and Thermal Drift Compensation*

---

## ❄️ Purpose

The Cryo Feedback Loop (CFL) stabilizes temperature within the vault chamber and CryoCore during high-energy field operations.

It ensures:
- STF fluid viscosity remains stable
- Meta-mirror lattice does not deform under EM/thermal load
- Vault chamber walls maintain subcritical expansion levels

## 🔁 Core Loop Functionality

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| CryoCore Temp Sensor (Contact) | RTD/PT100 class precision |
| IR Thermal Mapping            | FLIR-based live imaging |
| Coolant Flow Rate             | Hall-effect sensors |
| Ambient Temperature Drift     | External case temp sensors |

All inputs enter a PID loop optimized for **cryogenic gradients**, not ambient HVAC temps.

## 🔄 Output Control Actions

| Target | Control Mechanism | Response Type |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| Liquid Helium Pump | PWM motor driver | Flow rate throttle |
| Expansion Valve     | Solenoid + stepper | Fine-grain vapor pressure control |
| Emergency Shutoff   | Relay + dump valve | He loop isolation |
| CryoCore Bias Coil  | Thermal buffer logic | Adaptive offset based on beam activity |

---

## 📐 Loop Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Loop Cycle Time | 50 ms (continuous) |
| Setpoint Stability | ±0.12°C |
| Drift Tolerance | Max 1.5°C/min |
| Overshoot Clamp | <2% deviation |

PID tuning curves auto-adjust during:
- Vault startup
- High EM flux
- Sudden beam divergence events

## 🧠 Processor Integration

- Operates as dedicated submodule on **TunerCore DSP**
- Interrupt-safe architecture: isolates loop logic from phase feedback engine
- Cross-communicates with:
  - `/control/field-feedback-telemetry.md`  
  - `/subsystems/containment-envelope-modulator.md`

## ⚙️ Hardware Interface

| Component | Spec |
|-----------|------|
| Pump Controller | PWM 12V, linear throttle |
| Sensor Bus | I²C + analog failover |
| Valve Driver | Bi-directional stepper + relay |
| Coolant Type | He-4, optionally He-3 mix |
| Tubing | Non-conductive, cryo-stable (PEEK or Teflon) |

---

## 🚨 Emergency Modes

| Event | Trigger | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Leak Detected | Flow rate mismatch | Vault shutdown, valve lock |
| Thermal Spike | ΔT > 3°C in <2s | Emergency overcool pulse |
| Controller Loss | Watchdog trigger | Manual override required |
