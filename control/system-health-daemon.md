# System Health Daemon – IX-Singularis  
*Control Module: Real-Time System Integrity Watchdog + Response Manager*

---

## 🧠 Function Overview

The **System Health Daemon (SHD)** is the always-on logic core that:

- Monitors all critical subsystems
- Triggers fallback systems in <2 ms
- Logs data to internal blackbox
- Executes safe-state procedures under anomaly or drift conditions

This is the **mission-critical nerve center** for all IX-Singularis operational health.

## 📦 Actions on Trigger

| Trigger Event | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| Phase Drift > 2.5° | Pulse field re-aligner, log incident |
| Containment Field < 90% | Engage EVCA, pause beam |
| Cryo Sink Delay >18 ms | Activate cryo burst + telemetry flag |
| Node Sync Error >5 ns | Reboot affected node pair |
| Power Ripple >4.8% | Notify TunerCore, damp with ZeroCell assist |
| Hardware Disconnect | Immediate full system halt |

---

## 🗂️ Logging Behavior

- All events time-tagged to 1 μs precision
- Data stored in `/logs/runtime-integrity-digest.log`
- Failsafe mode: dumps to isolated blackbox core
- Optional external streaming via hardened UART or fiber serial link

---

## 🔐 Security Layer

- Codebase signed with SHA-3-512 ECC chain
- Physical override port requires quantum pin + offline key pair
- Firmware immutably hashed at boot (ROM-lock enabled)
- No wireless modules permitted

---

## 🧭 Failsafe Architecture

| Level | Trigger | Behavior |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Soft | Low-priority warnings | Log + flag |
| Hard | Integrity breach or sync fault | Initiate containment pause |
| Critical | Node loss or phase instability | Collapse field, eject core |

---

## 🧾 Notes

All logic is stateless between loops — no memory drift permitted.  
This daemon runs independently of beam pulse cycles and cannot be paused, downgraded, or re-prioritized by any subsystem.
