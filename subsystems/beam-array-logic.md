# Beam Array Logic – IX-Singularis  
*Subsystem Definition: Harmonic Beam Network for Full-Angle Containment*

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This subsystem defines the structural and harmonic logic of the **multi-beam array** used in IX-Singularis to generate a fully-enclosed field for particle containment. The beam system does not aim to destroy or ionize its target, but rather to encode a **harmonic pressure shell** around the sample — one that reflects, refracts, and redirects emissions back toward the source, suppressing decay and limiting radiation escape.

## 🔧 Configuration Overview

- **Total Nodes:** 36 beam emitters minimum (expandable to 72 for redundancy or lab calibration)
- **Arrangement Geometry:** Dual nested dodecahedral configuration (two interlocked Platonic solids)
- **Beam Type:** Low-energy, phase-tuned, modulated plasma channel with Tesla-coded harmonic signatures
- **Waveform Type:** 3-6-9 phase encoding (TunerCore-generated)
- **Pulse Mode:** Continuous wave + harmonic strobe pulse overlay for dynamic refraction modulation

## 🧬 Functional Roles

| Beam Group | Function |
|------------|----------|
| Primary 24 | Construct the stable harmonic torus field |  
| Secondary 12 | Handle adaptive refraction and resonance compensation for unstable emissions |
| Optional Overlays | Can be toggled in/out to pulse shock absorption harmonic deflections (STF sync layer) |

## 🧲 Real-World Beam Technologies

**Compatible with:**
- Tuned **Nd:YAG** beams (low energy)
- High-coherence **HeNe lasers** (for alignment and testing)
- **Non-ionizing UV/IR modulators** for passive harmonic imprinting
- **Electroplasma emitters** with modulated fields (phase-locked)

This system is not destructive — it does not cut, weld, or ablate.  
It is **constructive field engineering** in action.

## 🧠 Beam Logic Principles

### 1. **Spherical Phase Lock**
The beams encode harmonic pulses that create **nodes of standing resonance** in space — forming a 3D harmonic field trap.

### 2. **Angle-Encoded Suppression**
Each beam’s angle and phase pattern is tuned to match predicted emission vectors from the isotope. This provides **full angular cancellation** — outgoing particles re-encounter field walls tuned to their emission phase.

### 3. **Harmonic Counter-Spin Modulation**
TunerCore introduces a secondary spin field via wave phase inversion — suppressing decay tendencies through destructive interference logic.

All angles are non-repeating and derived from golden ratio harmonic spacing to avoid constructive resonance overlap.

🧩 Integration with Other Subsystems
Syncs with: /subsystems/TunerCore-behavior-logic.md

Drives: /containment/harmonic-pressure-envelope.md

Imprints onto: /subsystems/meta-mirror-nanosurface.md

Calibrated with: /simulation/phase-lag-analysis.md

🛡️ Safety
Beam energies are non-lethal

All nodes operate below ionization threshold

Auto shut-off occurs on phase drift >0.5%

🧪 Real-World Test Deployment
Proof-of-concept can be tested using beam emitter stands, TunerCore waveform generator (Python or FPGA-based), and field cameras (CCD or thermal imaging) to monitor standing wave structure.

Calibration mirrors can be aluminum micro-surfaces, laser-grade dielectric stacks, or MEMS-tuned arrays.

✅ Outcome
Creates a programmable pressure dome around an unstable element — a Tesla-style harmonic echo chamber that:

Suppresses, deflects, and reabsorbs emissions with no physical contact.
