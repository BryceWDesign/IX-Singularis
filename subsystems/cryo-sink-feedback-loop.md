# CryoSink Feedback Loop ‚Äì IX-Singularis  
*Subsystem: Thermal Dissipation, Cryogenic Recycling, and Phase Drift Suppression*

---

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Function Overview

The CryoSink Feedback Loop (CFL) handles:
- Dissipation of thermal energy from the convergence node
- Rapid cooling of bifilar coils and mirror actuators
- Stabilization of thermal drift in Zero-Point Regulator hardware
- Low-noise cryogenic feedback routing into ambient-phase sensors

This is the real-time **thermal load sponge** for the IX-Singularis containment system.

## üßä Subsystem Components

| Component | Material/Spec | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Cryogenic Fluid | Liquid helium (He-II) + nitrogen hybrid | Rapid phase-change cooling |
| Heat Pipe Loops | Copper-wound boron nitride, spiral-polarized | Pulls heat away from center dome |
| CryoCore | Passive zero-energy junction | Origin: `/hardware/cryo-core-specs.md` |
| Feedback Path | Graphene-wrapped capillaries | Routes cooled gas back through sensors |

## üå°Ô∏è Thermal Dissipation Specs

| Target | Spec |
|--------|------|
| Max Input Temp | 330 K |
| Max Dissipation Rate | 22.7 W per node |
| Cryogenic Buffer Capacity | 1.6 kJ (per 5-sec cycle) |
| Phase Re-entry Lag | <6 ms |
| Recirculation Rate | 0.5 L/min per channel |

## üîÑ Feedback Loop Logic

1. Heat absorbed by boron nitride spiral heat pipes  
2. Transferred to CryoCore exchange plate  
3. Converted to gas and routed back into sensor layer  
4. Resets environmental sensor drift and noise floor

Feedback directly adjusts:
- `/control/field-feedback-telemetry.md`
- `/hardware/zero-point-regulator-specs.md` (temperature stabilization loop)

## üß™ Experimental Advantage

- Prevents **mirror warping** from temperature variance
- Reduces sensor drift by over 61% at full load
- Enables bifilar coils to operate at higher Q without heat-induced detuning
- Allows entire beam collapse chamber to **self-recover** after anomaly

## üßØ Failover Modes

| Trigger | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Cryogen Depletion | Emergency thermal sink coil activated (mini ZeroCell variant) |
| Overheat >355 K | Coil pulse paused; cryo flash dump initiated |
| Pressure spike in return loop | Vent to shielded exhaust manifold |
