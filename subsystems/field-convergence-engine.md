# Field Convergence Engine – IX-Singularis  
*Subsystem: Harmonic Beam Collapse and Phase-locked Containment Envelope Generation*

---

## 🎯 Objective

The Field Convergence Engine (FCE) is the subsystem responsible for:
- Synchronizing **all harmonic beam outputs**
- Collapsing beams into a **central phase-locked envelope**
- Generating a stable **containment shell** around an exotic core (e.g., Element 115)

This is the Tesla-inspired harmonic choke point where beams cease traveling and begin shaping — not as heat, but as pressure-inward resonance.

## 🧬 System Inputs

| Source | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Bifilar Coils | Harmonic Pulses | Longitudinal Tesla-style 3-6-9 frequency beams |
| ZPR | Stabilized Vacuum Noise | Phase-matched low-current energy feed |
| TunerCore | Envelope Control | Modulates waveform timing and lock patterns |
| Telemetry | Field Feedback | Monitors edge leakage and collapse timing |

## 🛠️ Collapse Chamber Design

- Shape: **Icosahedral dome**
- Core cavity diameter: 7.4 cm
- Mirror Node Count: 20 primary, 60 secondary
- Phase Convergence Tolerance: ±0.6°
- Material: High-strength nonmagnetic composite (carbon-BN matrix)
- Internal Mounts: Cryo-floating ring + thermal insulators

## 🌀 Harmonic Collapse Logic

The 3-6-9 beams converge at precise delays such that:
T_converge = T₀ + nλ₃ ∩ mλ₆ ∩ pλ₉

Where:
- `λ₃`, `λ₆`, `λ₉` = wavelength of each base harmonic
- `T₀` = zero-field ignition marker
- Intersections create a **non-thermal field cage**

## 💡 Containment Envelope Parameters

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Shell Thickness | ~3.2 mm field pressure zone |
| Peak Field Strength | ~4.8 T equivalent |
| Containment Lag | <12 ns |
| Edge Drift Tolerance | <0.3 mm over 60 sec |
| Collapse Cycle | Every 128 ms or triggered burst mode

## 🔄 Feedback Control

Real-time data from:
- `/control/field-feedback-telemetry.md`
- `/simulation/element115-harmonic-model.sim`

Automatic tuning:
- Adjusts beam delay
- Retunes mirror tilt angle
- Engages compensatory ZeroCell feed for stability

## 🧯 Emergency Fail Conditions

| Trigger | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Core Thermal Surge | Beam cycle paused; CryoCore flash freeze initiates |
| Envelope Destabilization | Collapse mode inverted; field expanded outward safely |
| Feedback Loop Desync | Pulse mute until TunerCore re-syncs phase train |
