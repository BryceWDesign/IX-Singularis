# Beam Folding Matrix – IX-Singularis  
*Subsystem Documentation: Harmonic Convergence Array and Phase Folding Geometry*

---

## 🌀 Purpose

The Beam Folding Matrix (BFM) governs the spatial alignment and angular phase redirection of the 36-node harmonic beam array.  
Its purpose is to:

1. Achieve **multi-vector convergence** at the containment center (Element 115 core)
2. Maintain **destructive interference stability** at non-target zones
3. Enable **360° envelope symmetry** without angular phase loss

## 🔭 Physical Structure

- **Reflective Nodes:**  
  12–18 high-precision meta-mirror clusters  
  Positioned in dodecahedral symmetry around the vault chamber

- **Reflector Composition:**  
  - Substrate: diamond or sapphire wafer  
  - Coating: dielectric Bragg layer + gold topcoat  
  - Surface error tolerance: < λ/10 (for 405–1064 nm tuning)

- **Dynamic Alignment:**  
  - MEMS tilt encoders (resolution: ≤1 μrad)  
  - Motorized piezo-driven gimbals (feedback-looped via TunerCore)

## 🎯 Beam Behavior and Path Folding

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Input Beam Phase** | 3-6-9 harmonic locked, modulated by phase shifter in emitter |
| **Reflection Count** | 1–2 bounces per path, per beam, before convergence |
| **Output Convergence Zone** | 10mm radius sphere at vault center |
| **Angular Correction Range** | ±45° adaptive correction range per reflector |
| **Folding Logic** | Tesla-based harmonic symmetry matching golden angle divergence for non-overlap phase return suppression |

## 🧠 Field Geometry Optimization

- Folding geometry obeys modified **Gankyil triple symmetry**, embedded into:
  - Beam entrance angle
  - Reflector surface normal
  - EM field rotation rate (torsional vector folding)

- Goal: collapse beams into harmonic interference **nodes**, not interference **chaos**  
  → Result: focused energy delivery without diffraction spikes

---

## 🔒 Containment Contribution

The folding matrix contributes to safety and stability by:
- Reducing radiation scatter from misaligned beams
- Creating a **virtual pressure zone** around the core (non-contact harmonic cushion)
- Enabling **feedback-locked corrections** during field drift events (real-time adjustment)

---

## 🛠️ Control Inputs (via TunerCore)

- **Live phase tuning input**: DAC-controlled 0–360° per beam
- **Reflector angle feedback**: MEMS sensor bus (I²C or SPI)
- **Emergency lock-down mode**: freezes reflectors into last known stable state

---

## ⚙️ Fabrication Notes

- Mirrors must be produced in Class 10 cleanroom environment  
- MEMS gimbals must be shock-isolated during install  
- Reflectors should be aligned via laser interferometry before final STF layer is poured
