# TunerCore Behavior Logic ‚Äì IX-Singularis  
*Subsystem Definition: Tesla Harmonic Control and Real-Time Field Modulation*

---

## üéõÔ∏è Purpose

The **TunerCore** is the harmonic command center of IX-Singularis.  
It generates, controls, and adapts the **Tesla 3-6-9-based waveforms** that govern:

- Beam phase encoding
- Mirror surface resonance
- STF viscosity states
- Feedback loop logic from ZeroCell
- CryoCore environmental response
- Overall containment field coherence

This module is not ‚Äúpowered‚Äù in the conventional sense.  
It is **programmed resonance**, using digital or analog synthesis to shape fields.

## üîß Functional Breakdown

| Subsystem                 | Role |
|---------------------------|------|
| Harmonic generator core   | Produces Tesla-based waveform sequences |
| Phase encoder matrix      | Matches pulse to beam/mirror alignments |
| Feedback interpreter      | Reads ZeroCell and CryoCore metrics to adjust frequency |
| Reactive pulse controller | Sends harmonic strobe overlays to beam array |

## üß† Tesla 3-6-9 Waveform Logic

Nikola Tesla's resonance principles guide TunerCore logic:

- **3**: Base pulse rhythm (activation)
- **6**: Phase modulation window (adaptation)
- **9**: Reflection node encoding (containment loop)

These values are used not as numerology, but as real-world timing intervals and field sequencing methods:

Pulse Sequence Example:
Phase 1 (3) ‚Äî 33Hz
Phase 2 (6) ‚Äî 66Hz (mirror field ramp)
Phase 3 (9) ‚Äî 99Hz (containment harmonic lock)
Waveforms are not static. They are dynamically adjusted based on vault behavior.

üß¨ Modulation Capabilities
Function Target	Tuning Method
Beam Array	Sine/triangular wave blend
Meta-Mirror Surface	Pulse train with square harmonics
STF Viscosity	Amplitude-tuned sawtooth burst
CryoCore Sync	Phase delay harmonization
ZeroCell Control	Feedback-frequency response mapping

Each waveform packet is 3-phase encoded and repeated over Tesla-based Fibonacci-timed intervals (e.g., 3ms, 5ms, 8ms loops).

üñ•Ô∏è Hardware or Software Interface
Can be implemented via:

FPGA field programmable gate arrays

Analog signal generators with real-time mod knobs

Microcontroller (ESP32 / STM32) w/ waveform DACs

Python-based simulation using NumPy/SciPy waveform synthesis

Optional connection to /simulation/phase-lag-analysis.md for predictive decay timing compensation.

üîê Failover Modes
If ZeroCell fails, TunerCore maintains current pattern until manual override

If CryoCore exceeds temp delta, waveform enters ‚Äúpulse stutter‚Äù to drop energy input across beam array

If beam array pattern collapse is detected, TunerCore enters hard-stop and emits final 3-6-9 fallback burst to stabilize remaining field geometry

‚úÖ Outcome
TunerCore is the harmonic CPU of IX-Singularis.
It doesn‚Äôt process logic ‚Äî it processes field behavior.
By tuning frequency, amplitude, and pulse spacing across all subsystems, it holds the vault in quantum lock.
