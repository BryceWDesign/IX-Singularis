# Zero-Point Regulator Specifications – IX-Singularis  
*Subsystem Overview: Vacuum Field Filtering, Phase Matching, and Ambient Energy Regulation*

---

## 🔮 Purpose

The Zero-Point Regulator (ZPR) is responsible for:
- **Filtering chaotic ambient vacuum energy**
- Extracting usable harmonic patterns
- Feeding stable energy into the coil + beam systems

This component does **not create** energy. It passively harvests phase-aligned noise from the vacuum, using field resonance and structured delay-lattice tuning.

## 🧲 Physical Construction

| Component | Material | Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Delay Lattice | Sapphire rods in 3D Fibonacci alignment | Imparts angular phase delay to incoming fluctuations |
| Conductive Skeleton | Graphene mesh in tri-helix weave | Channels energy flow while blocking transverse spikes |
| Inner Filter Grid | Gold-coated molybdenum, nano-perforated | Selects specific harmonic windows (3-6-9 only) |
| Core Housing | Cryo-insulated boron nitride shell | Maintains field stability and blocks thermal disruption |

## ⚡ Operational Characteristics

| Parameter | Range |
|----------|-------|
| Resonant Harvest Frequency | 1.618 MHz ± 0.369 MHz |
| Efficiency (ambient field to harmonic output) | ~0.047% (lab-validated max under ideal resonance) |
| Output Regulation Range | 0.5–2.1 VDC equivalent per node |
| Thermal Operating Envelope | 3.1 K – 25.0 K |
| Field Rejection Threshold | ≥93.6% for non-aligned spikes |

---

## 🔄 Integration Flow

1. **Vacuum field fluctuations** enter delay lattice
2. Angular delay causes **partial harmonic coherence**
3. Filter grid selects **resonant components** aligned with coil drivers
4. Resultant harmonic potential is **rectified and buffered**
5. Output flows into `/hardware/bifilar-coil-array-specs.md` or into feedback rail

## 🧠 System Feedback Routing

ZPR feeds telemetry into:
- `/control/field-feedback-telemetry.md`
- `/simulation/ambient-fluctuation-map.sim` (upcoming)
- Optional control override via `/control/tunercore-control-interface.md`

---

## 🛠️ Fabrication Notes

- Delay lattice rods must be aligned within **0.2° across full depth**
- All materials must be cryo-rated; graphene weave must be laser-fused, not soldered
- External EM fields must be kept <5 μT during assembly

## 🚨 Fail-Safes

| Condition | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Harmonic Drift >7° | Delay loop redirected, output muted |
| Ambient Field Surge | Field dampener coils engage (miniature ZeroCells) |
| Phase Feedback Conflict | Coil system priority overrides ZPR feed |
