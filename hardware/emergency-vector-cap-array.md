# Emergency Vector Capacitance Array – IX-Singularis  
*Hardware Spec: Beam Divergence Vector Dump Grid and Energy Shunt Pathway*

---

## 🧨 Purpose

The Emergency Vector Capacitance Array (EVCA) is a **fail-open hardware grid** designed to:

- Redirect excess harmonic energy
- Collapse containment fields in a safe outward vector
- Prevent structural damage to surrounding components
- Absorb and temporarily store disbanded phase-locked energy

This is the **plasma fire extinguisher** of IX-Singularis.

## 🔧 Physical Design

| Feature | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Shape | Dodecahedral dome lattice |
| Cap Nodes | 60 high-cap boron-doped graphene layers |
| Radius | 10.5 cm from central core |
| Redundancy | 3x per vector axis (18 axes) |
| Total Cap Array | 180 nodes (3 per axis) |

Each node is tuned to **resonate destructively** with outgoing field vectors, siphoning energy via phase-cancellation.

## ⚙️ Operational Logic

### Normal State:
- Inert
- Passive monitoring of beam leakage via `/control/field-feedback-telemetry.md`

### Trigger State:
- Any beam phase loss >3.2%
- Thermal overpressure >0.5 atm
- Containment sync failure

### Response:
- Activates 180° opposing nodes to channel excess energy into cap array
- Capacitive capture duration: ~0.8–1.2 seconds
- Dissipates via grounded thermal lattice and ZeroCell-assisted EM bleed

## 📉 Discharge Rating

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Max Energy Capture | ~5.4 MJ (total) |
| Max Discharge Temp | ~740°C |
| Recycle Cooldown | ~12 sec (CryoSink assist) |
| Safe Failure Margin | ±16% vector drift |

## 🧯 Safety Features

- Self-purging aerogel membrane to eject thermal gas
- Redundant capacitive shunt banks (isolated grid logic)
- Field-backpressure venting to shielded carbon trap
- Optional physical ejector frame (auto-decouple if frame exceeds 3G)
