# Meta-Mirror Array Specifications – IX-Singularis  
*Physical Hardware Specs: Beam Folding System for Tesla-Based Harmonic Containment*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Define the construction, layout, and tolerances for the **Meta-Mirror Array** responsible for:
- Converging up to 36 longitudinal harmonic beams
- Reflecting them inward at programmable angles
- Forming a **harmonic convergence cage** around Element 115 (or other exotic core masses)

## 🔍 Mirror Array Geometry

| Layer | Function | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Primary Reflectors | Redirect external Tesla beams toward the core | 6–36 total; placed per axial harmonic logic |
| Foldback Mirrors | Create convergence from opposite angles | Enables full 360° closure |
| Inner Toroidal Ring | Maintains internal harmonic spin reflection | Located below the central containment node |
| Alignment Sensors | Laser-triangulated angular feedback | Tied into field telemetry system |

---

## 📐 Dimensional Specs

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Mirror Count | 18–36 (configurable) |
| Minimum Radius | 7.25 cm |
| Angular Precision | ±0.03° tilt |
| Surface Tolerance | λ/20 (EUV-compatible) |
| Material Thickness | 3.2 mm average |
| Backing Material | Non-magnetic titanium alloy or carbon graphite |

## 🪞 Mirror Surface Material

- Type: **Hybrid dielectric-silver multilayer**
- Reflectivity:
  - 98.4% @ 2.5 MHz harmonic waveforms
  - 96.9% @ thermal boundary excitation
- Surface Finish: Nano-polished <1 nm RMS
- Temperature Tolerance: Up to 540°C  
- Substrate: Fused silica or sapphire (laser-grade)

---

## 🧠 Sensor Feedback Integration

Each mirror hosts:
- Micro tilt actuator (piezo or MEMS-based)
- 3-axis IMU or beam deviation sensor
- Fiber-optic angle encoder for auto-correction

These feed into `/control/field-feedback-telemetry.md`

---

## ⚡ Beam Entry Ports

- Beams may enter from all 3 spatial axes (X, Y, Z)
- Toroidal mirrors fold X→Y→Z harmonics inward
- Custom porting available for ZeroCell-aligned harmonic harvesting

---

## 🧪 Assembly Notes

- Mirror array frame must be **non-conductive**
- Entire structure floats in suspended vacuum (zero contact with walls)
- Thermal contraction calibrated per material during cooldown to <5K
- Lattice locking requires interferometric confirmation before ignition

---

## 🧯 Failure Containment

| Scenario | Countermeasure |
|----------|----------------|
| Mirror Crack | Passive beam shutter triggers, reroutes convergence |
| Alignment Drift >0.1° | Telemetry flags system lockout |
| Surface Scorching | CryoCool jet precision burst and redirect routine |
