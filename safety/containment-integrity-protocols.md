# Containment Integrity Protocols – IX-Singularis  
*System-Level Safety Parameters, Field Stability Triggers, and Emergency Logic*

---

## 🛡️ Purpose

This file defines the containment system’s **live decision tree** for:
- Field envelope health
- Harmonic resonance drift
- Structural risk triggers
- Emergency fallback logic

This protocol stack determines whether the harmonic envelope around exotic matter (Element 115 or similar) remains **coherent, safe, and recoverable**.

## 📈 Core Monitored Metrics

| Parameter | Safe Threshold | Warning Range | Critical |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Phase Drift (degrees) | <0.9° | 0.9–2.5° | >2.5° |
| Thermal Envelope Lag | <9 ms | 9–18 ms | >18 ms |
| Core Chamber Pressure | 0.0–0.2 atm | 0.2–0.5 atm | >0.5 atm |
| Field Containment Integrity (%) | >97% | 90–97% | <90% |
| Node Synchronization Error | 0–2 ns | 2–5 ns | >5 ns |

## 🧠 Reactive Logic Tree

```pseudocode
if (PhaseDrift > 2.5° OR ContainmentIntegrity < 90%) {
   engage(emergency_collapse_abort)
   flush(ZeroPointFeed)
   trigger(cryocore_flash)
}

else if (ThermalLag > 18ms) {
   pause_beam_cycle()
   engage(cryo_overdrive)
}

else if (SyncError > 5ns) {
   re-align_nodes()
   notify(TunerCore)
}

🛑 Emergency Protocols
Event	Action
Chamber Breach Detected	Field collapse inward, core ejection to shielded flask
Node Phase Sync Loss	Beam freeze, delay line buffer reroute
Overpressure >0.5 atm	Vent to isolated shield capillary, neutralize field

🧪 Passive Safety Design
Redundant mirror phase locks

Ambient phase decoupling rails

Auto-isolated containment shell

Heat-exhaust divergence baffles

No single-point field integrity failure allowed

🧾 Notes
These protocols are not optional.
They must run at 10 kHz loop minimum, powered by dual redundancy TunerCore logic banks.
Safety override of any kind requires physical key interface and offline root signature.

🔖 Licensing
No usage of these protocols is allowed in systems that risk cascading energetic failure in open environments.
Military or weaponized override logic is prohibited.
All enforcement tied to /LICENSE.
