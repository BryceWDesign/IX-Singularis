# Radiation Trap Dynamics ‚Äì IX-Singularis  
*Simulation Overview: System Behavior Under Sustained Emission Conditions*

---

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Purpose

This simulation explores how IX-Singularis manages **sustained, multi-type radiation emissions**, including:

- Alpha particles  
- Gamma rays  
- Thermalized neutron flux  
- EM field turbulence from decay events

Focus is placed on **real-time field stability**, energy dissipation balance, and subsystem stress behavior over extended operation.

## üìà Expected System Behavior Timeline

```text
T+0s: Initial emission burst absorbed by STF  
T+2s: Gamma redirection load on meta-mirror rises  
T+5s: CryoCore cooling intensifies to compensate  
T+10s: TunerCore applies micro phase-adjustments to maintain envelope  
T+20s: ZeroCell ramps up to stabilize residual drift  
T+30s: Field successfully contains all emissions with <0.01% leakage  
T+33s: System enters cool-down recovery

üîÅ Variables to Explore
With and without CryoCore active

Alternate harmonic pattern sets (3-6-9 variants)

Fluctuating vs. constant emission rate

STF layer phase-shift lag impact

Alternate beam geometries (nested toroidal vs. dodecahedral)

‚úÖ Outcome
When properly tuned, IX-Singularis is expected to:

Maintain stable containment with <0.01% total emission loss, dynamically redirecting radiation via phase-layered geometry rather than brute-force absorption ‚Äî proving that Tesla-style resonance traps are viable at high-energy radiation levels.
