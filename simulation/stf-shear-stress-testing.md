# STF Shear Stress Testing – IX-Singularis  
*Simulation Overview: Fluid Lock-Up Behavior and Kinetic Burst Absorption Limits*

---

## 🧪 Purpose

This simulation validates the performance envelope of the **Shear Thickening Fluid (STF)** subsystem under high-velocity, short-duration force events — such as particle emissions, field shockwaves, or phase-failure energy spikes.

Focus:
- Viscosity transition timing
- Energy absorption threshold
- Structural recovery time
- STF failure modes under harmonic field influence

## 💧 STF Composition Recap

| Component           | Function |
|---------------------|----------|
| Polyethylene glycol | Carrier fluid |
| Silica nanoparticles (~300nm) | Shear response activation |
| Optional: CNT or graphene additives | Conductive enhancement or EM coupling (for harmonic tuning) |

## 🔬 Test Parameters

| Simulation Variable        | Range |
|-----------------------------|--------|
| Shear rate applied          | 50 to 50,000 s⁻¹ |
| Impact velocity             | 10 to 300 m/s |
| Pulse duration              | 10 μs to 1 ms |
| Fluid temperature           | –20°C to +60°C |
| STF layer thickness         | 3 mm (vault spec) |
| Harmonic overlay (active)  | ON vs. OFF toggle |

## ⚙️ Test Conditions

- STF placed between synthetic emitter core and mirror shell
- Impact pulses simulated using linear actuator model
- Viscosity measured in real time during each stress event
- Harmonic field present in control group: 3-6-9 waveform induced using external coil
- CryoCore cooling present or disabled per trial variant

## 📊 Key Measured Metrics

| Metric                         | Threshold Target |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| Lock-up response time          | ≤ 50 μs |
| Maximum energy absorbed (per event) | ≥ 120 J |
| Recovery time to fluid state   | ≤ 250 ms |
| Thermal rise under stress      | ≤ 5°C |
| Harmonic resonance interference | ≤ 2% field distortion during stiffening |

## 🧠 Results Interpretation

- Below 100 m/s: STF performs predictably, transitions within 30 μs  
- 100–200 m/s: Delayed stiffening observed when CryoCore disabled  
- 200+ m/s: Minor cavitation events detected — requires graphene reinforcement layer  
- Harmonic overlay improves shear uniformity and recovery sync by ~15–20%

## 🛠️ Suggested Toolchain

- `ANSYS Fluent` or `COMSOL Multiphysics` with rheology plug-ins  
- `MATLAB` or `Python` + `SciPy` for stress curve visualization  
- High-speed camera footage (1μs frame rate) for lab physical tests  
- Real-world comparison to ballistic gel + Kevlar-SiO₂ fluid testing

## 🧩 Integration Recap

- Encloses element core inside `/subsystems/STF-reactive-matrix.md`
- Backed by `/subsystems/cryoCore-stabilization-loop.md`
- Triggers harmonic alignment from `/subsystems/TunerCore-behavior-logic.md`

## ✅ Outcome

When built per IX-Singularis specs, STF can:

> Withstand and recover from microsecond-scale kinetic shock events,  
> stiffen under real-world emission bursts,  
> and protect harmonic systems without compromising containment timing.
