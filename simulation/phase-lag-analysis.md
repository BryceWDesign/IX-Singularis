# Phase Lag Analysis – IX-Singularis  
*Simulation Study: Harmonic Drift, Field Instability Onset, and Timing Compensation*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This simulation examines the most critical failure mode of IX-Singularis:  
**phase lag** — a delay between intended harmonic waveform synchronization across the beam array, TunerCore, mirror reflections, and feedback loops.

Even minor delays (on the order of nanoseconds) can:

- Break field coherence
- Collapse containment nodes
- Cause leakage of emission vectors

This file defines:
- Phase lag thresholds  
- Early warning signs  
- Correction strategies using real-world waveform compensation logic

## ⏱️ What Is Phase Lag?

> “Phase lag” is the difference in arrival time or phase angle between two otherwise synchronized waveforms, usually caused by:
- Signal delay
- Hardware thermal drift
- Loop feedback latency
- Nonlinear medium effects

In IX-Singularis, this happens when **one beam node** or **mirror patch** responds slower or out-of-phase with the others.

## ⚠️ Critical Thresholds

| Parameter                  | Max Tolerance |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| Absolute phase mismatch    | ≤ 0.05 radians |
| Delay between adjacent beams | ≤ 10 ns |
| Mirror reflectivity drop   | ≤ 2% within 5ms |
| TunerCore command latency  | ≤ 3.5 ms |
| ZeroCell loop drift        | ≤ 0.01% power error |

## 📉 Consequences of Phase Drift

1. **Wave Interference Collapse**  
   Constructive instead of destructive interference → emission escape

2. **Mirror Feedback Echo Failure**  
   Reflected phase reaches wrong target at wrong time

3. **Standing Wave Node Breakdown**  
   No cancellation = pressure bubble collapse

4. **Thermal Overcompensation**  
   CryoCore cannot isolate phase heat zones → sync loss accelerates

## 🧰 Tools Suggested

- Python `scipy.signal` for waveform timing
- Real-time plotting with `matplotlib.animation`
- Optional FPGA physical signal injection (using clocked DAC pulse arrays)
- Jupyter notebook for live feedback loop visualization

## 🔁 Recovery Methods

| Method                         | Trigger | Action |
|--------------------------------|---------|--------|
| TunerCore Phase Jitter Buffer  | 0.02 rad drift | Applies randomized harmonic pulse to reset waveform baseline |
| ZeroCell Drift Compensation    | EM feedback spike | Shifts power to weakest beam node first |
| CryoCore Zonal Freeze          | >4°C temp rise | Locks most volatile mirror node zone |
| STF Preload                   | Detected burst | Increases viscosity of STF to physically buffer drift moment |

---

## 🔬 Measurable Outputs

| Output                  | Ideal Value |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Total node sync error   | <1% at 30s |
| Recovery time           | <2.5s |
| Final field collapse risk | <0.01% |

---

## ✅ Outcome

Phase lag is the **invisible killer** of harmonic fields.  
But with active monitoring, predictive waveform control, and environmental sync loops, IX-Singularis can **self-correct and hold containment indefinitely** — even under heavy dynamic load.
